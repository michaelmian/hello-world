Ideas, resources, and things
My name is Michael and could just as well be a number or any other object representative of what I may or may not be. What does the color gray mean?

I'm learning more and more that Reality is information. My life is about how we see things, characterize/symbolize and subsequently relate them in the relevant ways to answer questions posed in a relevant form.
